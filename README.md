# Financial-Analyst-Case-Study
I analyze a large financial-related dataset, perform variance analysis, & create a dynamic dashboard in Excel.

In this exercise, I utlize a large financial-related dataset with ~200,000 rows & 12 columns. 

The data in this dataset contains information pertaining to Country, Region, Business Area, IT Area,
Cost Elements, Actual Expenditures, Forecasted Expenditures, Planned Expenditures, among other things. 

To analyze this dataset, I utilized a variety of Pivot Tables. From the Pivot Tables, I created Pivot Charts. 
And, I aggregated all of the relevant Pivot Charts into a Dynamic Dashboard in Excel. 

I reported connections among variables and relationships among information to create Slicers that will dynamically update
the Pivot Charts upon request. 

Moreover, throughout this project, I utlized a variety of Advanced Excel techniques such as complicated Conditional Formatting, 
Sparklines, changing Chart Elements, reporting connections among Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers, Custom Number Formatting, etc.

I later added another Excel file to demonstrate my profiency calculating financial concepts such as Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, 
EBITDA calculations, Cost of Capital, Discount Rates, Interest Rates, Economic Growth Rates, etc.
